# CountriesApp

### App built using Angular 17, following the Module-Based Architecture.

#### This is a basic app that allows you to find information about countries, such as the flag, capital, population, etc. The information is provided by the public API restcountries.com

### Concepts applied while building the app:

* Parent and Child Component communication through Input() and Output() decorators.
* Routing;  RouterModule.forRoot() and RouterModule.forChild()
* LazyLoad of Modules.
* HTTP Requests handling through HttpClientModule and Observables
